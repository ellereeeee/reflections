Question: 
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Answer: 
It showed the changes you made to the original version file that worked.  
Seeing the changes narrowed down the options for finding possible bugs.

Question: 
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Answer: 
By comparing old versions that work and a current verion with problematic bugs,
it is easier to find the bugs.  Also, if the programmer simply cannot find the bug,
they can restart from the most recent version that worked.

Question:
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when 
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?

Answer:
Manually choosing when to creat a commit is useful because they can have a single, 
logical purpose.  Also, you can make sure each commit is not too big or small.
Automatically saved versions may not make sense and in some cases the code may not even run.

Question:
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Answer:
I think Git allows saving multiple files in one commit because some code
projects require multiple files that are interconnected.  For example, a
webpage that uses html, css, and Javascript files.

I think Google Docs treats each files separately because they expect the user
to work on projects that require only one file, such as an essay.

Question:
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Answer:
Using git log shows all commits made in a repository.

Using git diff shows changes made between two different commits.

Question:
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Answer:
Because it is easy to restore your project to a version that works.

Question:
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Answer:
I want to try using Git for making my personal portfolio website.
