Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
The .git file is added to the directory that has been initialized to become a repository, but no commits are made.  

You need to do it so you can make it possible to make commits.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area is sort of a middle ground between the working directory and the repository.  
Instead of committing files directly from the working directory to the repository,
files are put into the working directory first.  Then, the user can decide to finally commit
these files to the repository.
