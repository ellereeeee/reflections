Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
1) Backing up your project files
2) Uploading your project for feedback from others
3) Collaborating on a project with others/making your project open source

Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
The user may later decide they don't want the changes made on GitHub,
so there would be no reason to pull changes yet.
