Question:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer:
1) Backing up your project files
2) Uploading your project for feedback from others
3) Collaborating on a project with others/making your project open source

Question:
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer:
The user may later decide they don't want the changes made on GitHub,
so there would be no reason to pull changes yet.

Question:
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer:
branch - a history of commits with the most recent one being at the end or "tip" of the branch.
Branches are created when the user wants to work on something while not affecting.
the production code.

clone - copying a repository.
Cloning is used when a user wants to copy a remote or local repository into another local repository.

fork - copying a remote from another user into a new remote repository of the user.
Used when you want the code from another user, while still crediting their work.

Question:
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Answer:
You can see how many commits you are ahead of the remote repo on GitHub.
If you're far ahead, it could be a good indicator to push your commits.
If you use git fetch, it can show how many commits you are behind,
or if there is a conflict between two commits.

Question:
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Answer:
You could send the files to each other via e-mail, or keep all of your versions
uploaded on a cloud service such as Dropbox.
If the user wasn't always making add, commit, push, and pull requests, then they may save some time.
Collaborating might be more difficult because you would have tell your partner
where you made changes, and you would to check if there are any conflicts,
which Github does for you.
